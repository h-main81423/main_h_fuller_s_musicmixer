# JavaScript Music Mixer Project
## Simon Fuller & Hayden Main
### Project Description

Creating a music mixer project similar to incredibox.com utilizing JavaScript
Utilizing beats, effects, melodies, and potentially voices to create a soundtrack loop.

### Developer Notes: Simon

### Designer Notes: Hayden
-The HTML/CSS should have a header for branding logo and menu bar for home/about/conact
-Should have a box in the middle of the the page as a container for the general music mixing program 
-Should have nav bar at the top of music-mixing container for music elements
-Icons should be simple enough to have the sound they make understood 
-Icons can have small size increase when hovered over for animations
-Synths and percussion for sounds
-Colours should refelct the sound genre, so neons or bold colours are probably best if we can make them work visually (mixing blacks with the neons for contrast)
-Use of self branding for figures (dissociative dude used in Final Integrated logo last semester)
-Simple animations for the figures when items dropped on
-Have a reset button at bottom right, outside of mixing container
-footer will contain same info as header
